# Step 3: Syft Installation + Homomorphic Encryption Demo

Once you've got a general understanding of the project, you'll want to start with the basics, getting Homomorphic Encryption up and running within Syft.

First, install Syft:https://github.com/OpenMined/Syft/
Second, test this notebook: https://github.com/OpenMined/Syft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Homomorphic%20Encryption%20Example.ipynb

# Step 4: Homomorphically Encrypted Linear Classifier Demo

Complete this Notebook: https://github.com/OpenMined/Syft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Encrypted%20Linear%20Classification.ipynb

# Step 5: Install Sonar, PySonar, and Demo

Install Sonar: https://github.com/OpenMined/Sonar
Install PySonar: https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar
Demo: Encrypted Neural Network on Test Ethereum Blockchain
https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/blob/master/notebooks/Sonar%20-%20Decentralized%20Model%20Training%20Simulation%20(local%20blockchain).ipynb

# Step 6: Congratulations!

You've completed the startup guide! Now, reach out to @trask on the Slack team so he can help you find your first project. Once your first Pull Request is merged into an OpenMined repository, you'll get your official invite to become a Member of the Github Organization!
