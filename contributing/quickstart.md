## Step 2: OpenMined Introduction

This video covers the project as a whole including high level goals and the broad architecture strategies (the big moving parts!).

## Step 3: Syft Installation + Homomorphic Encryption Demo

Once you've got a general understanding of the project, you'll want to start with the basics, getting Homomorphic Encryption up and running within Syft.

- [First, install Syft](https://github.com/OpenMined/Syft/)
- [Second, test this notebook](https://github.com/OpenMined/Syft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Homomorphic%20Encryption%20Example.ipynb)

## Step 4: Homomorphically Encrypted Linear Classifier Demo

[Complete this Notebook](https://github.com/OpenMined/Syft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Encrypted%20Linear%20Classification.ipynb)

## Step 5: Install Sonar, PySonar, and Demo

- [Install Sonar](https://github.com/OpenMined/Sonar)
- [Install PySonar](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar)
- Demo: Encrypted Neural Network on Test Ethereum Blockchain
  - https://github.com/OpenMined/PySonar/blob/master/notebooks/Sonar%20-%20Decentralized%20Model%20Training%20Simulation%20(local%20blockchain).ipynb

## Step 6: Install Zenhub Plugin

In order to see our documentation and issues in all their full glory, you'll want to install this browser plugin for Zenhub. Just navigate to http://zenhub.com and click the "Add ZenHub to GitHub" button.

## Step 7: Congratulations You're Ready!

You now have the basics of the OpenMined ecosystem up and running and are ready to take on Beginner level projects (Issues). We've gone out of our way to make sure that there are a plethora of mini-projects (Issues) that are 100% entry level. The way to find one is to pick any project and click the "Issues" Tab at the top. This should take you to a place that looks like this.

Next, you click "Labels -> Beginner". This will filter out all tickets except for the Beginner tickets. Click one of the tickets and you'll see something like this:

![https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/beginner_ticket.png](https://github.com/OpenMined/Docs/raw/master/img/beginner_ticket.png)

This ticket contains instructions for how to add a subtraction function to our Base Tensor object, with links to further documentation to help explain everything the ticket should do. If you have ANY questions about a ticket, simply message the person who created the ticket (in the ticket above, that's @trask on Slack)

Once your first Pull Request is merged into an OpenMined repository, you'll get your official invite to become a *Member of the Github Organization*!
