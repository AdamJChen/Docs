#### Naming

You are writing code for people to read just as much as machines. Be purposeful in naming, and respectful when other's critique names. This is not an exact science, but following these principals will help:

- Use helper verbs when describing state
```
Good:
`isValid`
`wasValid`

Bad:
`valid`
```
- Prioritize descriptive names over brevity
