    Farmer->>Open Mined: new model to train
    Open Mined->>Blockchain: propagate via model Farm to all mines
    Miner-->>Blockchain: Check regularly for new mdels fitting personal data mine
    Blockchain->>+Miner: Pick a model that is worth training
    IPFS->>Miner: Retrieve latest trained model configuration
    Note right of Miner: Train the model on local data owned by the Miner
    Miner->>IPFS: Store newly trained model
    Miner->>-Open Mined: Propagate new model version and achieved gradient
    Open Mined->>Blockchain: Update latest revision of trained model
    Open Mined-->>Miner: Cash out depending on achieved gradient
